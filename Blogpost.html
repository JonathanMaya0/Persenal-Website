                so far had issue that i still don't know how to fix i will research and figure out how to fix maybe i might need to change the name i am not sure.

                <p>Curently I got a way to host the project but it was not cloudflare
                  i had to improvise with something else it took me a bit but i got the website to work
                  using github pages. Now that this problem is fix what now will need to be fix now? the new proble is a problem that 
                  will not happen untill later but it is better to save this problem now and that is storage. That is the issue that I need to fix
